## Overview
My process

Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
Mobile-first workflow
Continued development

Improve the development by adding a custom QR code generator from which the user can enter their website and see the result displayed here with their custom text.
Will try to recreate the above improvement in VueJS/ReactJS.
